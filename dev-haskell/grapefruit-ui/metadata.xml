		Grapefruit is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) with a focus on
		user interfaces. FRP makes it possible to implement reactive and interactive systems
		in a declarative style. To learn more about FRP, have a look at
		&lt;http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming&gt;.
		
		This package contains general user interface support. To make use of it, it has to be
		complemented by a UI backend. It is possible to have different UI backends
		implementing the same general interface on top of different UI toolkits. At the
		moment, the only backend is one based on GTK+. This is provided by the
		grapefruit-ui-gtk package.
